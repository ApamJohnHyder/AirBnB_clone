This is the first portion of a project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. The first goal of this project is to create a program that serializes and deserializes objects into json files, and reloads them on startup for use between sessions, or in other words making the data persist between sessions.

The second goal of the project is to build a console to manage all this stored data. The console is made to update, delete, and create new instances of any class of data. It also keeps track of when the objects it has made were created, and updated.
